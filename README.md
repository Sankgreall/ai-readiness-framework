# AI Readiness Assessment Framework

This framework provides organisations with a structured approach to assess their readiness for implementing and managing AI/ML initiatives. The framework is designed to evaluate the maturity of an organisation across 23 individual controls, providing insight into their preparedness for AI-driven change.

## Who is this for?

This framework was primarily created for Professional Service organisations, like consultancies, law firms, and accountants. These types of organisations are most likely to make use of third-party technology products, and can therefore reap significant benefits for their business if their team is ready to realise them.

It is not designed for organisations who may be creating or training their own models. These types of organisations face a more complex control landscape that this framework is not designed to assess.

## Framework Structure

- **23 Individual Controls**: These controls represent various facets of an organisation's AI readiness.

- **DEISIO Rating System**: Every control is evaluated against a DEISIO rating, ranging from 1 - 5. 

## DEISIO Rating Definitions

1. **DEVELOPING**: At the initial stage of readiness with a basic understanding but lacking strategy or dedicated resources.

2. **EXPLORING**: Actively seeking knowledge and understanding, possibly with a dedicated team, but no measurable outcomes.

3. **IMPLEMENTING**: Started to implement changes with a clear strategy and dedicated resources.

4. **SCALING**: Successfully implemented projects and scaling efforts with changes becoming an integral part of operations.

5. **OPTIMISING**: Fully integrated changes, with continuous improvements and exploration of advanced techniques.

## Interpretation of Scores

- **Overall Score > 3**: Indicates that an organisation has sufficient maturity across the control domains to lead effective AI/ML initiatives.

- **Overall Score < 3**: Indicates that an organisation should prioritise addressing areas of weaknesses before launching AI/ML initiatives.

## Repository Contents

- **Spreadsheet**: This repository contains a spreadsheet with the 23 controls alongside an example assessment.

## How to Use

1. Review the 23 individual controls and understand their relevance to your organisation.
2. Assign a DEISIO rating for each control based on your organisation's current stage.
3. Calculate the average rating across each control domain and for the overall score.
4. Refer to the interpretation of scores to determine the next steps for your organisation.
